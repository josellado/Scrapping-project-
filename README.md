<img src=https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-fff1ebe90ea7af1736a46c1ef684562b>

The wizarding world is going through extremely dark times, and Hogwarts is not a safe place anymore, You-know-Who has returned, and it's getting stronger by the minute. Therefore Albus Dumbledore  asked his three favourite students:

1) Harry Potter
2) Ron Weasley 
3) Hermione Grainger 

To conduct a secret analysis to find out how many allies he has,  and to produce a list of possible outstanding wizards to join him in the fight.

# DATA 
To do so, the three students downloaded a data frame (link found at description) with the top students of Hogwarts (graduated or not) containing valuable data and characteristics, such as wand description, house, etc. 

Enriching the data set with a magical API (link at description) 

# EXECUTE PROGRAM 

Albus Dumbledore has its army divided up into 3 different organizations (columns of the data set) 
1) Ministry of Magic 
2) Order of The phoenix 
3) Albus Dumbledore Army. 

If a wizard is part of any of the organizations, it will be shown with a True in the corresponding column, if not a False will be shown.

Thanks to Arguments Parse with a simple line, the program will show whether a wizard is part of an organization or not.


    "To execute the program through the terminal, you must fork and clone all the available files."

1) In your terminal navigate to the repository 

2) Write python3 main.py, these will saw all the wizards that are not part of any organization. Therefore they are possible candidates to join the fight

-  -m, --ministry Of Magic: Allies at the ministry
- -p, Order Of The Phoenix: Wizards living at 12 Grimmauld Place, London 
- -d, dumbledores Army: Wizards at the Room of Requirement

    "example: python3 main.py -m"
